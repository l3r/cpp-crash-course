C++ Crash Course Files

I've commented all my perspectives as a developer that came 
from JavaScript, Java, Python etc. on this amazing language C++.

I didn't write anything about ifs, elses, for, whiles, because it's
common for any other language. But I provided comment on everything 
that I thought is specific related to C++. 

By the way, it's fruit of this amazing course
