# C++ Crash Course Review in Code

I tried to comment all my perspectives as a developer that came 
from another regular languages like JAVA and JavaScript on this 
amazing language called C++.

I didn't write anything about ifs, elses, for, whiles, because it's common 
and I assume is pretty similar for any other language (not FPs though). 

Instead, I provided comments on everything that I believe could help 
any developer to read, understand and hopefully write good C++ code.

By the way, this is fruit of this amazing course
